# Aperture Scatterguard and Scintillator Collisions

If the aperture/scatterguard are not moved sensibly in y it is possible for the scatterguard to collide with the cryostream. See the below diagram...

If for example the top aperture is to be chosen then the whole assembly must move down so that the top aperture matches the beam then the scatterguard up to match the top aperture. If instead the bottom aperture is chosen then the scatterguard must move down then the whole assembly moved up.

The aperture/scatterguard may also collide with the scintillator as described by the diagram below.

Normally the scintillator is stowed behind the aperture/scatterguard in the z direction, to move it into position it must be moved in front; to do this the aperture/scatterguard must be moved sideways in the -ve x direction out of the way.

The aperture/scatterguard must be moved in the -ve x direction in order to avoid colliding with the scintillator when it is 
moved in / out (scintillator only has motion in the y, z axes).
