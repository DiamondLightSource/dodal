"""
Bluesky distinguishes between `plans`: complete experimental proceedures, which open and
close data collection runs, and which may be part of a larger plan that collect data
multiple times, but may also be run alone to collect data, and `plan_stubs`: which
do not create & complete data collection runs and are either isolated behaviours or
building blocks for plans.

In order to make it clearer when a MsgGenerator can be safely used without considering
the enclosing run (as opening a run whilst in a run without explicitly passing a RunID
is likely to cause both runs to fail), when it is required to manage a run and when
running a procedure will create data documents, we have adopted this standard.

We further impose other requirements on both plans and stubs exported from these modules
to enable them to be exposed in UIs in a consistent way:
- They must have a docstring
- They must not use variadic arguments (*args, **kwargs)
- Plans must and Stubs may have an optional argument for metadata, named "metadata"
- The metadata argument, where present, must be optional with a default of None
