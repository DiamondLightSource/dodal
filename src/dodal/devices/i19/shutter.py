    This device evaluates the hutch state value to work out which of the two I19 \
    hutches is in use and then implements the HutchShutter device to operate the \
    experimental shutter.
    As the two hutches are located in series, checking the hutch in use is necessary to \
    avoid accidentally operating the shutter from one hutch while the other has beamtime.

    The hutch name should be passed to the device upon instantiation. If this does not \
    coincide with the current hutch in use, a warning will be logged and the shutter \
    will not be operated. This is to allow for testing of plans.
    An error will instead be raised if the hutch state reads as "INVALID".
