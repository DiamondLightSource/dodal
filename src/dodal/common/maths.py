def step_to_num(start: float, stop: float, step: float) -> Tuple[float, float, int]:
    """
    Standard handling for converting from start, stop, step to start, stop, num
    Forces step to be same direction as length
    Includes a final point if it is within 1% of the final step, prevents floating
    point arithmatic errors from giving inconsistent shaped scans between steps of an
    outer axis.

    Args:
        start (float):
            Start of length, will be returned unchanged
        stop (float):
            End of length, if length/step does not divide cleanly will be returned
            extended up to 1% of step, or else truncated.
        step (float):
            Length of a step along the line formed from start to stop.
            If stop < start, will be coerced to be backwards.

    Returns:
        start, adjusted_stop, num = Tuple[float, float, int]
        start will be returned unchanged
        adjusted_stop = start + (num - 1) * step
        num is the maximal number of steps that could fit into the length.

def in_micros(t: float) -> int:

    number of microseconds.
